Projects for Algorithms in Bioinformatics

[Project 1](https://github.com/Delirra/AiB_projects/tree/main/Project_1) - Global alignment with linear gap cost

[Project 2](https://github.com/Delirra/AiB_projects/tree/main/Project_2) - Global alignment with linear and affine gap cost

[Project 3](https://github.com/Delirra/AiB_projects/tree/main/Project_3) - Multiple Sequence Alignment algorithms; two different implementations have been are included:
One ([sp_exact_3.py](https://github.com/Delirra/AiB_projects/tree/main/Project_3/sp_exact_3.py)) creates an exact multiple alignment between exactly three sequences;
the other ([sp_approx.py](https://github.com/Delirra/AiB_projects/tree/main/Project_3/sp_approx.py)) creates an approximate alignment based on Gusfield's 2-approximation algorithm between any number of sequences.
